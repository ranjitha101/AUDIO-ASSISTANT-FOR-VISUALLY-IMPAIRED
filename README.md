# AUDIO-ASSISTANT-FOR-VISUALLY-IMPAIRED
Object Detection System for the Visually Impaired is a Python-based assistive technology project that uses YOLO (You Only Look Once) deep learning model to detect objects in real-time through a camera feed. The system processes video frames using OpenCV, identifies objects, and provides audio feedback using pyttsx3 text-to-speech engine, enabling visually impaired users to understand their surroundings.

This solution runs offline, requiring no internet connection after setup, and is optimized for speed and accessibility. It can be used with webcams, USB cameras, or embedded devices like Raspberry Pi, and can be extended to support distance estimation, multilingual audio, or integration into wearable devices.
